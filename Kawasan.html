               <p style = "font-family: Comic Sans MS"><b>Turquoise blue water</b>, <b>3 stages of waterfalls</b> and <b>canyoneering</b> – A gentle hush of rushing ice cool water.. All this and more in Badian’s Kawasan Falls!
                  <br>
                  Just 130 kilometers southwest of Cebu City and about <b>three hours bus ride</b>, the Kawasan Falls is located inside the mountains of Barangay <b>Matutinao, Badian</b>. From the entrance you will have to trek uphill for about thirty minutes, depending on your pace, to get to the first waterfall. Along the way, souvenir shops selling accessories such as beaded necklace, bracelets, and Kawasan print t-shirts are available for sale if you want to bring home souviners with you.
                  <br>
                  Kawasan has <b>three waterfalls</b>. The first one is mainly the largest of the three, and is usually the most crowded. An uphill climb for fifteen minutes will take you to the second falls, and another, to the third. You may bring in food, or buy from the resort’s restaurants. Cottages and tables are also available for rent, as well as rooms for overnight stay. You may rent a raft to take you around the <b>“pool”</b> or for a refreshing <b>“shower massage”</b> under the falling water. Life vests are also available for a very affordable price.
